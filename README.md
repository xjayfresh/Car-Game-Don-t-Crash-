# Car-Game-Don-t-Crash-
Project description - “Car game, don’t crash!”

Rules:
The point of this is to drive you car without running into any walls or potholes.
To move your car, you may make a car noises if you wish, or just simply blow on it, that’ll make your car go forward. The circuit playground will pick up noise which will make your car go forward.
Pot holes will appear up randomly, they’ll appear as a different color (yellow), in order to avoid them you must turn!
Indicating that you won, the circuit playground will turn all the LEDs into a rainbow pattern along with having a consistent pitch sound.
Indicating that you lose, the circuit playground will turn all the LEDs into a twinkle pattern (singular red dots) along with having a lower consistent pitch sound.


Inputs: Mimicking a car noise or blowing, Movement (left and right),

Outputs: LED car movement, LED patterns (rainbow and confetti), consistent game winning sound (or loosing sound)
